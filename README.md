# SteamOS-RPCS3 on Steam Deck to play Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots

**Ready customised versions** of RPCS3 for Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots on our decks!

# Why this project

We all know that our decks struggle with the emulation of "Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots". This project tries to bring the best version of the emulator to our decks.

For this, an AppImage compiled directly on the deck and only for the deck (zen2) is generated. These AppImages bring the community modifications (cipherxof and illusion0001) so famous from RPCS3.

# Is it playable?

Just like the official RPCS3 version, these versions are not perfect: bugs in missing sounds, not stable fps, ... 
Don't expect to play Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of Patriots perfectly, but it's a good option to enjoy this wonderful game.

# Best version

I'm currently compiling versions of cipherxof and illusion0001 and both work decently. The build of the cipherxof's version I would say is less stable, but gains more fps. The build of illusion0001's version is more stable, but at the cost of less fps.
